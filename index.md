I'm a Ph.D. Student in Machine Learning, working at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se) under the project *Scalable resource-efficient systems for big data analytics*. My advisors are [Håkan Grahn](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/hakan-grahn-hgr/), [Marie Netz](), and [Veselka Boeva](https://www.bth.se/staff/veselka-boeva-vbx/).


Currently, I'm  working on my licentiate thesis where the focus is on modeling and analyzing user behaviors. Specifically, we have focused on user behaviors of electricity consumption.

Link to the current version of the licentiate thesis is found [here](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:bth-18667)
