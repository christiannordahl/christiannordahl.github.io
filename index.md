I'm a Ph.D. Student in Machine Learning, working at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se) under the project *Scalable resource-efficient systems for big data analytics*. My advisors are [Håkan Grahn](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/hakan-grahn-hgr/), [Marie Netz](), and [Veselka Boeva](https://www.bth.se/staff/veselka-boeva-vbx/).


Currently, I'm  working on my licentiate thesis where the focus is on modeling and analyzing user behaviors. Specifically, we have focused on user behaviors of electricity consumption. It consists of the following publications:

* Nordahl, C., Grahn, H., & Persson-Netz, M. "Detection of residents’ abnormal behaviour by analysing energy consumption of individual households". In \textit{2017 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW)}, 1st International Workshop on Aging, Rehabilitation, and Ambient Assisted Living (ARIAL), 2017, New Orleans, Florida, USA, pp. 729-738. DOI: [10.1109/ICDMW.2017.101](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2017.101)
