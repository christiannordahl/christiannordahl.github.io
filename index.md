I'm a Ph.D. Student in Machine Learning, working at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se) under the project *Scalable resource-efficient systems for big data analytics*. My advisors are [HÃ¥kan Grahn](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/hakan-grahn-hgr/), [Marie Netz](), and [Veselka Boeva](https://www.bth.se/staff/veselka-boeva-vbx/).


I'm currently working on my licentiate thesis, where the focus is on modeling and analyzing user behaviors. Specifically, we have focused on user behaviors of electricity consumption.
