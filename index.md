I am a PhD candidate in Machine Learning at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se), in Sweden. I am working under the project *Scalable resource- efficient systems for big data analytics* funded by the [Knowledge Foundation](http://www.kks.se), advised by [Niklas Lavesson](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/niklas-lavesson-nla/) and [HÃ¥kan Grahn](https://www.bth.se/eng/staff/hakan-grahn-hgr/).


The main focus of my thesis is on making **machine learning** algorithms more **energy efficient**.
In particular, I have studied the energy consumption patterns of **streaming algorithms**, and then proposed new algorithm extensions that reduce their energy consumption.
Some of my research interests are the following:
Energy Efficiency in Machine Learning, **Green AI**, High Performance Computing, Big Data and Streaming Data, Green Computing.
